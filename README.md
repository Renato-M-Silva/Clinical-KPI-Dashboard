# 🏥 Clinical KPI Dashboard  
A complete end‑to‑end healthcare analytics project using Python, Power BI and ETL pipelines.

This project simulates a real clinical rehabilitation workflow, transforming raw patient data into actionable insights through data cleaning, exploratory analysis, KPI generation and interactive dashboards.  
It was designed to demonstrate professional skills in Healthcare Data Analysis, ETL, Python, DAX, and Power BI dashboard design.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

This project analyzes synthetic clinical rehabilitation data, focusing on patient recovery, pain reduction, mobility improvement and treatment efficiency.  
The goal is to build a full analytical pipeline that mirrors real-world healthcare analytics tasks:

- Data ingestion  
- Data cleaning and validation  
- KPI creation  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Clinical visualizations  
- Power BI dashboard  
- ETL automation

## ⚙️ ETL Pipeline

The ETL pipeline (`etl_pipeline.py`) performs:

- Loading raw clinical data  
- Removing duplicates  
- Converting date formats  
- Creating KPIs (recovery days, pain improvement, mobility gain, success flag)  
- Exporting cleaned dataset for analysis and dashboarding  

This ensures a reproducible and automated workflow.

---

## 📈 Power BI Dashboard

The dashboard includes:

### Page 1 — Overview
- Recovery KPIs  
- Pain & mobility KPIs  
- Success Rate  
- Sessions average  

### Page 2 — Injury Type Analysis
- Recovery by injury type  
- Success rate by injury type  
- Pain & mobility distribution  

### Page 3 — Patient Evolution
- Pain initial vs final  
- Mobility initial vs final  

### Page 4 — Treatment Efficiency
- Sessions vs recovery days  
- Efficiency insights  

The `.pbix` file is available in the `powerbi/` folder.

## 🔬 Key Insights

- Muscle injuries recover faster and show higher mobility gains.  
- Joint injuries require more sessions and have lower success rates.  
- Pain improvement strongly correlates with mobility gain.  
- Most successful cases occur with fewer than 12 sessions.  
- Higher initial mobility predicts faster recovery.  

These insights mimic real rehabilitation analytics used in clinical decision-making.
